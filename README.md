2. New Thread Strategy - âœ… YES, Good Idea
Given the token limits, starting a new thread for major feature development is wise.

Recommended Approach:
Current Thread (This one): Foundation Complete âœ…

Basic Django setup

Database configuration

Models created

Data imported

Authentication working

Admin interface ready

New Thread: Feature Development ðŸš€

Attendance system implementation

Role-based dashboards

Reporting features

UI enhancements

Testing and deployment

How to Continue:
Set up Git (as above)

Push to remote repository (GitHub/GitLab)

Save this continuity document in your project docs

Start new thread when beginning feature development

Reference this foundation in the new thread

What to Include in New Thread:
Link to Git repository

Current status summary

Specific feature requests

Any new requirements

Immediate Action Plan:
Set up Git (15 minutes)

Push to GitHub (10 minutes)

Document current state (5 minutes)

Start new thread for Phase 2 (when ready)

Would you like me to guide you through the Git setup and GitHub repository creation now? This is the perfect time to establish proper version control before adding new features.

What to Share in New Thread:
GitHub repo URL

The 3 documents you mentioned:
